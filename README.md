# AR Virtual Trial App for Walmart's Sparkathon

## Project Overview

In the current e-commerce landscape, customers often face difficulties in accurately visualizing and sizing products when shopping online. This disconnect frequently leads to high return rates and customer dissatisfaction. To address this challenge, our team has developed an innovative AR Virtual Trial app. This app seamlessly integrates with Walmart’s e-commerce platform, allowing customers to visualize products in their own space with real-time adjustments, thereby enhancing the online shopping experie...

## Problem Statement

Consumers struggle to accurately visualize and size products when shopping online, leading to a significant gap between customer expectations and the actual products received. This results in increased return rates and decreased customer satisfaction.

## Solution

Our AR Virtual Trial app offers a solution by enabling customers to place products in their own space through augmented reality, providing real-time size adjustments and visualizations. This reduces uncertainty, aligns the online shopping experience with that of physical retail, and improves overall customer satisfaction.

## Features

- **Advanced 3D Modeling**: Sophisticated 3D models that provide detailed and accurate representations of products.
- **Real-Time AR Adjustments**: Customers can adjust product size and placement in real-time using augmented reality technology.
- **Seamless Integration with Walmart's Website**: Direct integration with Walmart's e-commerce platform ensures a smooth and enhanced shopping experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Include the frontend technologies you used, e.g., React, Angular]
- **Backend**: [List backend technologies, e.g., Node.js, Python]
- **AR Framework**: [Mention the AR framework used, e.g., ARKit, ARCore]
- **Database**: [Include database technologies, e.g., MongoDB, MySQL]

## Future Goals

1. **Strengthen Integration with Walmart's Ecosystem**: Expand the app’s compatibility across Walmart’s in-store kiosks and mobile platforms to provide a unified omnichannel shopping experience.
2. **Upgrade Backend Systems for Personalization**: Enhance backend infrastructure to offer personalized product recommendations based on user interactions with the AR app, improving the shopping experience.
3. **Advanced 3D Modeling Enhancements**: Broaden the app’s 3D modeling capabilities to support a wider range of products with greater detail and accuracy.
